# smart-parking-system
The system simulates a city-wide parking management service. Vehicles request parking in  specific zones. Parking slots are allocated based on proximity, availability, and zone rules.  Each parking request follows a strict lifecycle and may be cancelled, triggering rollback. The  system maintains a complete history of parking usage for analytics.
